To note -> The Remote API uses a library that, in the case of Windows, is already supplied as a .dll for both 32-bit and 64-bit OSs. For linux and MacOS, this library must be compiled. The files are available at "V-REP Install Folder"/programming/remoteApiBindings/lib or "V-REP Install Folder"/programming/remoteApi
